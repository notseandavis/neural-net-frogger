# Neural Net Frogger (Sean's personal learning tool)
## This application *_does not follow best practices_* for software design, and it is intentionally a mess. This is my personal learning tool for understanding neural networks. 

This is the starting point for a web-based neural net that can learn to play a simple game

To run:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`
